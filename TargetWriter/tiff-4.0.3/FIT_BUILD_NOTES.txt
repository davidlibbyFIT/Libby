From a 32-Bit VS Command Line...

vsvars32.bat


nmake /f Makefile.vc clean
nmake /f Makefile.vc

And then from a 64-Bit VS Command Line...

nmake /f Makefile.vc clean
nmake /f Makefile.vc

The binaries will be deposited in the libtiff folder. I moved them into platform specific 
libs folder.

It should be noted that we've built libtiff with a modified nmake.opt file. We changed the 
compiler flags so that libtiff is linked against the "Mulithreaded" VC libs (/MT) instead 
of the "Multithreaded DLL" VC libs (/MD).
